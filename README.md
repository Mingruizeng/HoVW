# Hierarchy-of-Visual-Words Framework
The Hierarchy-of-Visual-Words (HoVW) framework is a trademark image retrieval method that decomposes images into simpler geometric shapes and defines a descriptor for trademark image representation by encoding the hierarchical arrangement of component shapes. The proposed hierarchical organization of visual data stores each component shape as a visual word. It is capable of representing the geometry of individual elements and the topology of the trademark image, making the descriptor robust against linear as well as to some level of nonlinear transformation.

## Run
To evaluate the HoVW framework follow the `HoVW/pipeline.sh` (Linux or MacOS) or `HoVW/pipeline.sh` (Windows).
